# Container Images

These [container images](https://github.com/truecharts/containers) are tailored for Kubernetes.

## Purpose

The goal of this project and the container images are to support [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), security and native K8S support.
We try to keep a [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) when building these images, which means no [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) and all images are built on top of [ubuntu:focal](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu).

## Configuration

In order to get the Container images repository and tags see [here](https://github.com/orgs/truecharts/packages?ecosystem=container&visibility=public).

For configuration and documentation see [here](https://truecharts/containers/getting-started/).

## Support

We have several different methods for getting support.
