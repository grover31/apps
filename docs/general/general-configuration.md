# General Configuration

There are some setting that are always present on every App from TrueCharts.

##### Explaination sheet:

- **timezone**

_Select your timezone for correct time inside the containers_


- **PUID**

_Select the user id of the user running your application. Defaults to 568 aka the `apps` user_


- **PGID**

_Select the group of the user running your application. Defaults to 568 aka the `apps` group_


- **UMASK**

_The mask here gets substracted from the default CHOWN setting of your App, it's an advanced setting and we advice not to change this unless you already know what UMASK does_.
